            <p>
                Created a page inside <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaming/">Facebook gaming</a> where users can go to manage preferences for creators, streamers, and communities. 
                I Explored two MVPs that were organized in different ways and were visually distinct from each other as well as multiple 
                North Star explorations using two distinct design systems. Collaborated with Engineers to gain insight into the feasibility of 
                the ideas of my project, a Content Designer to identify the wording of descriptions 
                inside my project and a User Experience Researchers to identify the motivations and needs of the user.
