                  <h1>Hi!!! I'm Mateo Lopez</h1>
                  <p>
                        Solving puzzles, Rubik's cubes and understanding how things work have always been important interests in my life. 
                        During my childhood, my love for video games fueled an interest for knowing how computers are used to build the games that I played. 
                        Along side my interest in  <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">video games</a>, I have always had a passion for creativity and style that has always driven my interests and hobbies. 
                        These interests have guided my path up until now in college where I chose to major in Computer Science here at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M</a>. 
                        Recently, I decided to combine my interest in technology and my passion for creativity and began exploring more creative-focused tech 
                        career paths and decided to develop a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/5VRICYw7jLBj8u0oJMRTTz/Portfolio-UI---Web-%26-Mobile-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1">portfolio</a> 
                        of the creative work I did in the past. In doing so, I was able to land an internship at <a href="https://about.facebook.com/">Meta</a>. 
                        Meta is such an amazing company full of such knowledgeable people and I value my time there very much. 
                        I was able to learn and experience so much in the 10 weeks that I worked there. During my time there, 
                        I worked with engineers, designers, researchers, and product managers to make my work the very best that it could have been. 
                        Each person provided a different outlook on my project whether it was technical aspects or high level aspects, any feedback 
                        I could receive from them I took advantage of. Learning about the company and the variety of teams that all work on different products was 
                        really intriguing because you will always have something you will want to work on. Not only, was the work there exciting, but exploring

Being thrown into a new city without anyone 
                        I knew and by being able to adapt to it, I proved to myself that I am ready for what the world has to offer!
